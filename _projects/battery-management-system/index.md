title: Battery Management System
description: A fully custom Battery Management System (BMS) I designed for the 2025 ANU Solar Racing iteration. Designed to monitor and maintain the 160V battery pack and all lithium ion cells present within it. Developed with cutting edge safety technology through the TI BQ796XX-Q1 chipset with safety, reliability, efficiency and cost at the forefront. Through this project I learned and tested years of circuit, PCB and microcontroller software design, with hand soldering and rigorous testing leading to a design I am incredibly proud of.


skills: 
  - High Voltage (300VDC) Design
  - Analog Signals
  - Analog Front-End Design
  - PCB Design and Implementation
  - Microcontrollers
